This is my first learning project on Heckleset, which is a program of five games - "Mind Games"

Mind Games is a set of five console games based on the principle of popular mobile brain—boosting applications. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, it is considered that the game is over. Incorrect answers end the game and offer to go through it again. Games:

- Calculator. Arithmetic expressions that need to be calculated
- The progression. Searching for missing numbers in a sequence of numbers
- Determining an even number 
- Determining the largest common divisor 
- Definition of a prime number

Installation Instructions
1. Install Python 3.6 or higher.
2. Make sure that you have a fresh pip installed. To do this, call python3 -m pip --version. You will need version 19 and higher. If necessary, update pip with the python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user pip command. 
3. Install the poetry package manager. Configure poetry so that it creates virtual environments in the project directory — run the poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true command.
4. Clone the created project repository locally (git clone https://github.com/webdron/python-project-49).
5. Run the command 'poetry install' in the root directory of the project
6. Further launch of games can be performed by commands:
	brain-exe = Parity check
	brain-calc = Calculator
	brain-gcd = The largest common divisor
	brain-progression = Arithmetic progression
	brain-prime = A prime number

You can watch the installation process in the video:
